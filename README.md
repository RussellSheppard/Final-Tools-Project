# Final-Tools-Project
The final data tools project
Data Performance Roadmap:
"Why did you choose the variables?"
I had selected the variables "Country", "Treatment", "Mental_vs_physical", "seek_help", and "family_history". I selected country, because I wanted to see the attitude towards mental health on a global scale, instead of simply a single country. I then selected the other variables that would be effective in seeing the numbers on whether people received help, if there was family history of mental illness, the comparison of mental vs physical, and so on. They all provide relevant yet distinct metrics towards our investigation.

"What problems did you encounter during the analysis?"
The major problem I encountered in my analysis was visualization. I had issues comparing two categorical metrics at a time. I decided to then complete the rest of my visualizations in R, in order to see country/(whichever other varaible), and how they differed. This was intended to ultamitely answer our question: How do the attitudes towards mental health vary by region?

"Did you uncover new information through the analysis?" 
I had found that any question I had visualized(i.e. Family history by country), had the majority in United States, Canada, UK, and so on. I found this interesting, however it leads me to believe that if possible, perhaps more insights could be found with focusing on specific countries. This could also benefit those countries by using the insights to increase the mental health support in those respective areas.
